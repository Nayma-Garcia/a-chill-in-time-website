        <p className="description">
          The game starts with a detective being pulled into his boss's office and sent undercover to the town of Scarlettville, a quaint village with a dark secret: a centuries-old cold case that needs solving.
        </p>
        <p className="description">
          To crack the case, the detective must gain the trust of the townspeople, who aren't easy to talk to. By completing quests, doing favors, and giving gifts, you'll slowly uncover cluesâ€”but not everything will be given away so easily.
        </p>
        <p className="description">
          The detective's cover job as a landscaper keeps him busy with daily tasks around the town, but he can also take on personal jobs from the townspeople. Explore, build relationships, and discover hidden secrets!
